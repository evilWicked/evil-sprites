# evil-sprites
A simple 2D OpenGL Scene Graph for use as a basis for 2D GL apps, games ui's etc.

It's early days yet but what this project aims to do is construct a a simple heirarchy
of 2D sprites to be used with projects that already use Open GL and perhaps GLFW, SDL,
SFML etc.

It will simply be a sprite class inspired by Phaser.js that can be used to build anything
from user interfaces to games.  

It is not intended to be a game library - simply a tool to manage bitmaps on a screen. 
It will handle mouse events, local to global transformations and might depending on how 
things go include a tween class although I might break that out on its own.
